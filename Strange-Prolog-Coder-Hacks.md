Prolog programmers often unconventional techniques to handle scenarios like undefined predicates, conditional execution, or prototyping code. This page documents some of these seemingly nonsensical things you'll see in the mettalog codebase.

## The `nop/1` Predicate

### Example:

```prolog
nop(_).

do_stuff:- 
  nop(step1),
  step2.
```

### Explanation:

The `nop/1` predicate always succeeds without doing anything, regardless of the argument passed to it. This trick is useful for temporarily disabling parts of code while maintaining readability and structure.

### Why Use It?

- **Placeholders for Disabled or Future Code**: Use `nop/1` as a quick way to "comment out" code without removing it.
- **Debugging and Prototyping**: Selectively deactivate steps in a process without breaking the flow of the program.
- **Readable and Modular Code**: Even when a step is inactive, it remains visible in the code, preserving the overall structure.

## Delayed Code Definition with `call(call, ...)`

### Example:

```prolog
do_something:- 
  call(call, some_pred(stuff)).
```

### Explanation:

In SWI-Prolog, when you use `call(some_pred(stuff))` and `some_pred/1` is not yet defined, you’ll receive a warning like "Procedure some_pred/1 does not exist." However, by wrapping the call in an extra `call`, like `call(call, some_pred(stuff))`, you can reference a predicate that hasn’t been defined yet without triggering this warning.

### Why Use It?

- **Deferring Definition**: This trick is handy when you want to reference a predicate that you’ll define later. It allows you to build the structure of your code without needing every part implemented upfront.
- **Modular Development**: You can design complex systems where certain predicates are loaded or defined dynamically, while still referencing them early in the code.
- **Avoiding Compilation Warnings**: SWI-Prolog is smart enough to issue warnings about undefined predicates when you use `call(some_pred(stuff))`. Using `call(call, some_pred(stuff))` suppresses these warnings until the predicate is defined.

### How It Works:

- The first `call` effectively delays the evaluation of the inner `call(some_pred(stuff))`, allowing Prolog to treat it as a more dynamic or indirect reference.
- Once `some_pred/1` is eventually defined, the code will run as expected.

### When to Use It:

- For scenarios where predicates are loaded dynamically, such as in modular or plugin-based systems.
- When you’re building code that evolves over time, and you want to define certain predicates later, use `nop/1` instead.


Here’s an expanded section for the **Strange_Prolog_Coder_Hacks** wiki page that includes using `fail/0` to effectively comment out an entire clause:

---

## Using `fail/0` to Comment Out an Entire Clause

### Example:

```prolog
do_something :-
    step1,
    step2,
    step3.

do_something_else :-
    fail,  % This clause will always fail, effectively commenting it out
    stepA,
    stepB,
    stepC.
```

### Explanation:

The `fail/0` predicate is built into Prolog and, as the name suggests, it always fails. By placing `fail/0` as the first goal in a clause, the entire clause will immediately fail when executed, preventing any further goals in that clause from being evaluated.

### Why Use It?

1. **Temporarily Disable a Clause**: During development, you might want to disable a specific clause without removing it from the code. Using `fail/0` is a quick and effective way to "comment out" the entire clause while keeping it in place.

2. **Preserve the Structure for Future Use**: Unlike traditional commenting (using `%` for line comments), using `fail/0` allows you to keep the clause intact and visible within your code. This is useful when you plan to re-enable or modify the clause later.

3. **Maintain Control Over Clauses Without Deleting Them**: By using `fail/0`, you can easily revert back to the original functionality by simply removing or commenting out the `fail/0` line.

### How It Works:

When Prolog encounters `fail/0` in a clause, it stops evaluating the remaining goals in that clause and immediately considers the clause as having failed. If there are other clauses for the same predicate, Prolog will attempt to match those instead. If there are no other clauses, Prolog will return `false` for that predicate.

### Example Use Cases:

- **Debugging and Testing**: If you’re testing a different implementation or alternative logic, you can temporarily disable the original clause using `fail/0`.
- **Prototyping**: When you’re unsure about the behavior of a specific clause or want to delay its execution until later, using `fail/0` allows you to keep it in the codebase without it being active.
- **Conditional Logic**: In some cases, you may want to programmatically control whether a clause should be active or not. By conditionally including or excluding `fail/0`, you can switch between enabling and disabling a clause.

### Potential Pitfalls:

- Be cautious when using this technique, as leaving `fail/0` in place for too long can lead to forgotten or outdated code being left inactive in your project.
- It’s easy to forget why a clause was disabled with `fail/0`, so consider adding a comment explaining the reason if it’s a temporary measure.
- While `fail/0` is an effective tool, if you simply want to disable a single goal rather than the entire clause, traditional line comments using `%` might be more appropriate.

Here’s an addition to the **Strange_Prolog_Coder_Hacks** wiki page that explains using a cut (`!`) in the first clause to temporarily comment out all clauses below it:

---

# Strange Prolog Coder Hacks

Prolog provides a number of powerful tools that, when used creatively, can lead to clever solutions for common development challenges. One such hack involves using a cut (`!`) at the beginning of a clause to temporarily prevent other clauses from being considered.

## Hack 2: Using a Cut (`!`) to Temporarily Disable Clauses Below It

### Example:

```prolog
do_something :-
    !,  % Cut prevents any further clauses from being considered
    step1,
    step2.

do_something :-
    stepA,
    stepB.

do_something :-
    stepX,
    stepY.
```

### Explanation:

In Prolog, the cut (`!`) is used to commit to a specific choice, preventing Prolog from backtracking and considering alternative clauses. By placing a cut at the beginning of the first clause, you effectively disable all the clauses below it, making Prolog commit to the first clause regardless of whether it succeeds or fails.

### Why Use It?

1. **Temporarily Disable Lower Clauses**: If you’re still developing or refining the logic in the clauses below, you can use this technique to prevent Prolog from even considering them until they’re ready.

2. **Controlled Testing of a Single Clause**: During development, you may want to test just one specific implementation of a predicate. By placing a cut in the first clause, you ensure that only this clause is executed, while the others are temporarily ignored.

3. **Postpone Decisions on Deleting Clauses**: If you’re unsure whether you want to delete certain clauses, using a cut allows you to effectively "comment them out" without losing the code. You can later decide whether to keep or remove them based on further testing.

### How It Works:

- The cut (`!`) in Prolog tells the interpreter, "Commit to this choice and don’t backtrack." When placed at the start of a clause, it guarantees that if this clause is reached, no further clauses will be evaluated, even if this clause fails.
- As a result, all clauses below the one with the cut are effectively ignored.

### Example Use Cases:

- **Incremental Development**: If you’re working on new logic and want to focus on testing one particular approach, you can temporarily disable the other clauses using a cut.
- **Selective Clause Activation**: When you have multiple versions of a predicate, you can use a cut to activate only one version while leaving the others in place for future comparison.
- **Deferred Cleanup**: Before permanently deleting old or deprecated clauses, you can disable them with a cut while ensuring the code remains functional.

### Potential Pitfalls:

- **Unintended Behavior**: The cut completely blocks backtracking, so if the first clause fails, Prolog won’t attempt any of the remaining clauses. This can lead to unexpected failures if you forget the cut is in place.
- **Hidden Logic**: The clauses below the cut are still in your code, which can be confusing for others (or even yourself) if it’s not clear why they aren’t being executed.

### Best Practices:

- Clearly document the use of this technique, especially if it’s temporary. Add comments explaining why the cut is used and when the blocked clauses should be reactivated or removed.
- If the cut is being used for debugging, consider removing it once the debugging phase is complete to avoid leaving inactive code in the project.
- Using a cut (`!`) at the start of a clause is a clever way to "comment out" all lower clauses temporarily. It’s a practical technique for incremental development, controlled testing, and delaying the decision to delete code until you’re sure it’s no longer needed.
